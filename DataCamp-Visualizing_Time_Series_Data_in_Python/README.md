# Visualizing Time Series Data in Python

## Description :

Time Series data is generally present in the field of Data Science. Whether to analyze trends and forecasting company's trends.

In this repository, I have explained how to start working with time series data, and how to visualize the time series data using Python.

This repository is further divided into 4 sub-chapters - 

- **Chapter-1 : Introduction to Time Series Plots**
- **Chapter-2 : Plotting Rolling Models and Aggregate Values Models**
- **Chapter-3 : Autocorrelation, Partial Autocorrelation Plots and Seasonality, Trend and Noise Plots in Time Series Data**
- **Chapter-4 : Work with Multiple Time Series Data**

## 1. [CHAPTER-1](https://github.com/ilyak93/Visualizing-Time-Series-Data-in-Python/tree/main/Chapter-1)
In this chapter, I have explained how to leverage basic plottings tools in Python, and how to annotate and personalize your time series plots.

## 2. [CHAPTER-2](https://github.com/ilyak93/Visualizing-Time-Series-Data-in-Python/tree/main/Chapter-2)
In this chapter, I have explained about deeper understanding of our time series data by computing summary statistics and plotting aggregated values from our data.

## 3. [CHAPTER-3](https://github.com/ilyak93/Visualizing-Time-Series-Data-in-Python/tree/main/Chapter-3)
In this chapter, I have explained about autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots.

And, also explained how to detect seasonality, trend and noise in time series data.

## 4. [CHAPTER-4](https://github.com/ilyak93/Visualizing-Time-Series-Data-in-Python/tree/main/Chapter-4)
In the field of Data Science, it is common to work with multiple time series simultaneously.

In this chapter, I have explained how to plot multiple time series at once, and how to discover and describe relationships between multiple time series.
